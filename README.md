## Situated objects

This is student project, so really not worth looking at. But that being said, if you care to check it out: this is a browser extension (so you'll need to download it/clone it) and then go into google chrome's extensions (chrome://extensions), enable dev mode, and then "load unpacked" extension. Head over to wikipedia to try it out. Fair warning: it really only works with lemons, large orange balls, a roll of electrical tape, a small fake potted plant, and a large red clip (for closing bags of potato chips or cereal).

I'll eventually get a blog post written up for this, so the demo video and images will be much more explanatory.

Essentially I trained 3 models over at google's [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and then loaded the best one into a browser extension. I fiddled around with javascript so that a screen reader user (or anyone using a keyboard) can assign locations on a webpage to one of the random objects. Then you can travel back to previously "saved" locations by bringing the object back into view. This requires a camera with a pretty clean background.
